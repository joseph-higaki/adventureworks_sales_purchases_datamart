The document "Adventureworks.Sales.Purchases.DataManagement" was made in Google Docs and explain the work of our assignment. 
We published in both formats so that our teachers review whichever is easier for them:
Adventureworks.Sales.Purchases.DataManagement.docx
Adventureworks.Sales.Purchases.DataManagement.pdf 

In that document, there's an appendix explaining the supporting technical files: *.ktr, *.kjb, *.sql
